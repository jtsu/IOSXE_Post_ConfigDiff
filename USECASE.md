IOS-XE Post ConfigDiff
=====================================================
Tracking IOS-XE config diffs in collaboration clients 


Some times it can be difficult to identify exactly what config changes were make on a Cisco switch or router. There are certainly applications on the market to help examine and identify configuration differences. But it would be better to see and track an audit trail of the differences.

We created a simple application that would track configuration changes and post those changes to a Webex Teams room. With all the changes now posted in a room, it is very easy to scroll back in time to see what changes were made.

Webex Teams isn't universally used by all our customers, so we also wanted to incorporate some options in our app to post to other collaboration clients. We included options to post messages to Microsoft Teams and Slack.

One of the limitations we have is that we do our diff to a baseline config. It would be great to have an option to see a diff to a prior version.
